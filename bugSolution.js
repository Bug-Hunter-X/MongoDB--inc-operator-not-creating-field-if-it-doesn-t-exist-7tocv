```javascript
// Correct use of $inc and $setOnInsert operators to handle missing fields
db.collection.updateOne({"_id":ObjectId("651234567890")},{
    $inc: {"counter": -1},
    $setOnInsert: {"counter": 0}
});
//The $setOnInsert operator ensures that the field is created if it doesn't exist and initialized to 0. $inc will work as expected if it already exists.
```
